The Digits data set of the Scikit-learn library provides numerous data-sets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Some Scientist claims that it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times. Perform data Analysis to accept or reject this Hypothesis.

Conclusion :

As per our hypothesis, we can say with hyperparameter tunning with different machine learning models or using more data we can achieve near 95% accuracy on the handwritten dataset. But make sure we also have a good amount of test data otherwise the model will get overfit.
