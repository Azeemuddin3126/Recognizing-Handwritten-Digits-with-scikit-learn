# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn
Conclusion :

As per our hypothesis, we can say with hyperparameter tunning with different machine learning models or using more data we can achieve near 95% accuracy on the handwritten dataset. But make sure we also have a good amount of test data otherwise the model will get overfit.
